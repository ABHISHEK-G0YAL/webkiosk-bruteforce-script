# webkiosk-brute-force-script
Simple python script, nothing fancy, just for fun, to get webkiosk passwords....🙃\
Basically, for "parents part" of webkiosk, the password has a general pattern, and that is what I exploited.
## Usage:
```bash
python script2.py <roll_no> <birthdate>
```
`birthdate in format as:  29 Feb 2013 === 29022013`

OR
```bash
python all_pwd.py <roll_no>
```
`If birthdate is unknown:  It will take time, alot of it`

enjoy....😊
